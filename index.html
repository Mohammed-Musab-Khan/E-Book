                    Vega’s summer vacation is not going well.
                    When her parents decide it’s time to pack up and leave her hometown of Portland, Oregon, behind for
                    boring Seattle, Washington, Vega is more than upset—she’s downright miserable. Forced to leave her
                    one
                    and only best friend, Halley, behind, Vega is convinced she’ll never make another friend again.

                    synthesizing the philosophies of Machiavelli, Sun-tzu, Carl von Clausewitz, and other great

                    The Gifts of Imperfection, teaches us not to change ourselves to adapt to
                    expectations, instead, we should embrace and engage with our
                    imperfections. The core insights center on empathy, understanding, and
                    adopting "wholehearted living," so that we start living for ourselves, and
                    not for other people.
